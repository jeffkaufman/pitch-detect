Usage:

1. Install portaudio:

    $ wget http://www.portaudio.com/archives/pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz
    $ tar -xvzf pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz
    $ cd portaudio
    $ ./configure --disable-mac-universal
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

2. Build it:

    make

3. Put on headphones, use a highly directional mic, or otherwise avoid letting
   the output of this program mix with the input.

4. Run it and whistle:

    make run

It will make a virtual midi source, which you can then pipe into a
synthesizer.

There's also a version with its own built-in bass synthesizer, which is a
plgg-in version for a DAW (like Reaper):
